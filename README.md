This work is made possible by the grant of the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT, Republic of Korea (NRF-2017M3A9E4061992). Original genomic sequences were produced by the participating research groups and registered into the GenBank database of National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD, USA). The genomic sequences of the reference viruses were downloaded from the GenBank database and used for this project. If you intend to use original genomic sequences or the results above for publication, please contact to the PI of each participating research group (influenza virus, ms0392@korea.ac.kr; severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), chonh@snu.ac.kr; and hantavirus, jwsong@korea.ac.kr).
